### Example Messaging

**For Landing Page**:
> "Your AI agent doesn't need dashboards. It needs observations.
>
> KernelSight AI transforms kernel-level telemetry into semantic signals that Gemini 3 can reason about—natural language observations, not metrics. No human interpretation required."

**For GitHub README**:
> "An agent perception platform that transforms eBPF kernel telemetry into natural language observations for Gemini 3. Instead of metrics, your AI sees 'Memory pressure elevated for 12 minutes' with evidence, recommendations, and correlation."

**For Conference Talk**:
> "What does an AI agent see when it looks at your system? Not metrics—observations. KernelSight AI is a semantic signal layer that transforms syscalls, scheduler events, and memory stats into narratives that Gemini 3 can reason about autonomously."
